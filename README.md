# paperlaunch

Getting LaTeX projects up and running with version control

## Usage

Get a GitHub API token from your Github account settings. All it needs
is access to repositories.

The API token and name of your organisation account, if appropriate,
are set in a configuration file. Copy the `settings.conf.example` file
to `settings.conf` and update this with your details.

## Templates

The included templates reflect ajjackson's own use case. A citation is
included for two reasons: 

1. to avoid breaking the Makefile by giving Bibtex nothing to do, and
2. because I usually end up citing this paper anyway!
